## MVVM üß®
If you are a developer, you might have heard of MVVM, which stands for Model View ViewModel. A good way to practice clean code is to look around and learn to form others' code. This project implements the power of MVVM to structure the code to make it clean to understand and to debug errors. It makes the code easily readable.

## Why to use Swiftdata üìä
SwiftData is a powerful and expressive persistence framework built for Swift. It is an easy-to-use way to store data in apps built for iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and even visionOS. It can be easily used to implememt **Searching**, **filtering**, **fetching** data, and much more.
